# Regular Expressions Cheatsheet

After reading the great book [Mastering Regular
Expressions](http://regex.info/book.html) by Jeffrey Friedl, I tried to find
a good cheatsheet about regular expressions, but I could not find one showing
all the things I wanted to remember, or have at hand, from this book. So
I wrote my own.

## More than a cheatsheet

You will see it is not just a cheatsheet, as it brings more useful information for quick reference.
The document is divided in the following sections:

1. Regular Expressions Basics (a cheatsheet)
2. Regular Expressions Advanced (another cheatsheet)
3. Regular Expressions and Special Characters (another, very specific, cheatsheet)
4. Regular Expressions Examples (two pages of very useful examples for real-life problems)
5. Regular Expressions in Programming Languages and Tools (examples on different languages and tools)

If you want to really understand what is shown in this document (and much more!) you have to read Friedl's book.
